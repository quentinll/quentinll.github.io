    <div class="abstract hidden">
      <p>Collision detection is a fundamental computational problem in various domains, such as robotics, computational physics, and computer graphics. In general, collision detection is tackled as a computational geometry problem, with the so-called Gilbert, Johnson, and Keerthi (GJK) algorithm being the most adopted solution nowadays. While introduced in 1988, GJK remains the most effective solution to compute the distance or the collision between two 3D convex geometries. Over the years, it was shown to be efficient, scalable, and generic, operating on a broad class of convex shapes, ranging from simple primitives (sphere, ellipsoid, box, cone, capsule, etc.) to complex meshes involving thousands of vertices. In this article, we introduce several contributions to accelerate collision detection and distance computation between convex geometries by leveraging the fact that these two problems are fundamentally optimization problems. Notably, we establish that the GJK algorithm is a specific sub-case of the well-established Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm in convex optimization. By adapting recent works linking Polyak and Nesterov accelerations to Frank-Wolfe methods, we also propose two accelerated extensions of the classic GJK algorithm. Through an extensive benchmark over millions of collision pairs involving objects of daily life, we show that these two accelerated GJK extensions significantly reduce the overall computational burden of collision detection, leading to up to two times faster computation timings. Finally, we hope this work will significantly reduce the computational cost of modern robotic simulators, allowing the speed-up of modern robotic applications that heavily rely on simulation, such as reinforcement learning or trajectory optimization. </p>

      <p>Physics simulation is ubiquitous in robotics. Whether in model-based approaches (e.g., trajectory optimization), or model-free algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning), physics simulators are a central component of modern control pipelines in robotics. Over the past decades, several robotic simulators have been developed, each with dedicated contact modeling assumptions and algorithmic solutions. In this article, we survey the main contact models and the associated numerical methods commonly used in robotics for simulating advanced robot motions involving contact interactions. In particular, we recall the physical laws underlying contacts and friction (i.e., Signorini condition, Coulombâ€™s law, and the maximum dissipation principle), and how they are transcribed in current simulators. For each physics engine, we expose their inherent physical relaxations along with their limitations due to the numerical techniques employed. Based on our study, we propose theoretically grounded quantitative criteria on which we build benchmarks assessing both the physical and computational aspects of simulation. We support our work with an open-source and efficient C++ implementation of the existing algorithmic variations. Our results demonstrate that some approximations or algorithms commonly used in robotics can severely widen the reality gap and impact target applications. We hope this work will help motivate the development of new contact models, contact solvers, and robotic simulators in general, at the root of recent progress in motion generation in robotics. </p>

      <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) and trajectory optimization (TO) present strong complementary advantages. On one hand, RL approaches are able to learn global control policies directly from data, but generally require large sample sizes to properly converge towards feasible policies. On the other hand, TO methods are able to exploit gradient-based information extracted from simulators to quickly converge towards a locally optimal control trajectory which is only valid within the vicinity of the solution. Over the past decade, several approaches have aimed to adequately combine the two classes of methods in order to obtain the best of both worlds. Following on from this line of research, we propose several improvements on top of these approaches to learn global control policies quicker, notably by leveraging sensitivity information stemming from TO methods via Sobolev learning, and augmented Lagrangian techniques to enforce the consensus between TO and policy learning. We evaluate the benefits of these improvements on various classical tasks in robotics through comparison with existing approaches in the literature. </p>

      <p>In the past few years, following the differentiable programming paradigm, there has been a growing interest in computing the gradient information of physical processes (e.g., physical simulation, image rendering). However, such processes may be non-differentiable or yield uninformative gradients (i.d., null almost everywhere). When faced with the former pitfalls, gradients estimated via analytical expression or numerical techniques such as automatic differentiation and finite differences, make classical optimization schemes converge towards poor quality solutions. Thus, relying only on the local information provided by these gradients is often not sufficient to solve advanced optimization problems involving such physical processes, notably when they are subject to non-smoothness and non-convexity issues. In this work, inspired by the field of zero-th order optimization, we leverage randomized smoothing to augment differentiable physics by estimating gradients in a neighborhood. Our experiments suggest that integrating this approach inside optimization algorithms may be fruitful for tasks as varied as mesh reconstruction from images or optimal control of robotic systems subject to contact and friction issues.</p>

In this work we show that collision detection is fundamentally a convex optimization problem.

      <p>Reasoning about 3D scenes from their 2D image projections is one of the core problems in computer vision. Solutions to this inverse and ill-posed problem typically involve a search for models that best explain observed image data. Notably, images depend both on the properties of observed scenes and on the process of image formation. Hence, if optimization techniques should be used to explain images, it is crucial to design differentiable functions for the projection of 3D scenes into images, also known as differentiable rendering. Previous approaches to differentiable rendering typically replace non-differentiable operations by smooth approximations, impacting the subsequent 3D estimation. In this paper, we take a more general approach and study differentiable renderers through the prism of randomized optimization and the related notion of perturbed optimizers. In particular, our work highlights the link between some well-known differentiable renderer formulations and randomly smoothed optimizers, and introduces differentiable perturbed renderers. We also propose a variance reduction mechanism to alleviate the computational burden inherent to perturbed optimizers and introduce an adaptive scheme to automatically adjust the smoothing parameters of the rendering process. We apply our method to 3D scene reconstruction and demonstrate its advantages on the tasks of 6D pose estimation and 3D mesh reconstruction. By providing informative gradients that can be used as a strong supervisory signal, we demonstrate the benefits of perturbed renderers to obtain more accurate solutions when compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives using smooth gradient approximations. </p>

      <p>Simulating frictional contacts remains a challenging research topic in robotics. Recently, differentiable physics emerged and has proven to be a key element in modelbased Reinforcement Learning (RL) and optimal control fields. However, most of the current formulations deploy coarse approximations of the underlying physical principles. Indeed, the classic simulators lose precision by casting the Nonlinear Complementarity Problem (NCP) of frictional contact into a Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) to simplify computations. Moreover, such methods deploy non-smooth operations and cannot be automatically differentiated. In this paper, we propose (i) an extension of the staggered projections algorithm for more accurate solutions of the problem of contacts with friction. Based on this formulation, we introduce (ii) a differentiable simulator and an efficient way to compute the analytical derivatives of the involved optimization problems. Finally, (iii) we validate the proposed framework with a set of experiments to present a possible application of our differentiable simulator. In particular, using our approach we demonstrate accurate estimation of friction coefficients and object masses both in synthetic and real experiments. </p>

  <span class="na">abstract</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">{Simulating frictional contacts remains a challenging research topic in robotics. Recently, differentiable physics emerged and has proven to be a key element in modelbased Reinforcement Learning (RL) and optimal control fields. However, most of the current formulations deploy coarse approximations of the underlying physical principles. Indeed, the classic simulators lose precision by casting the Nonlinear Complementarity Problem (NCP) of frictional contact into a Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) to simplify computations. Moreover, such methods deploy non-smooth operations and cannot be automatically differentiated. In this paper, we propose (i) an extension of the staggered projections algorithm for more accurate solutions of the problem of contacts with friction. Based on this formulation, we introduce (ii) a differentiable simulator and an efficient way to compute the analytical derivatives of the involved optimization problems. Finally, (iii) we validate the proposed framework with a set of experiments to present a possible application of our differentiable simulator. In particular, using our approach we demonstrate accurate estimation of friction coefficients and object masses both in synthetic and real experiments. }</span>
