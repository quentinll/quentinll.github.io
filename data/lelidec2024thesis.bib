  abstract    = {Optimization is ubiquitous in modern robotics. Whether it is to simulate or to control a robot, numerical optimization algorithms appear to be core building blocks. Learning-based approaches rely on the ability to compute gradients and greatly benefited from the emergence of open-source automatic-differentiation libraries (e.g., PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow). This thesis aims to pursue this effort and bring some fundamental robotics tools to the differentiable programming paradigm. Starting from physical first principles, we look at robot simulation through the lens of numerical optimization techniques. We consider both the theoretical and implementation aspects to derive efficient algorithms for computing and differentiating the physics of a robotics system. Exploiting the resulting physical models, we highlight the remaining challenges to tackle locomotion and manipulation tasks and propose approaches for learning controllers.}
