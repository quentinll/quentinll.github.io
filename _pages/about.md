I am a Ph.D. student under the supervision of [Justin Carpentier](https://jcarpent.github.io/), [Ivan Laptev](https://www.di.ens.fr/~laptev/) and [Cordelia Schmid](https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/people_webpages/cordelia/). I work in the [WILLOW](https://www.di.ens.fr/willow) team in Paris, which is a joint team between INRIA Paris, ENS Paris and CNRS.

Prior to that, I received an engineering degree from Ecole Polytechnique and a MSc degree in Mathematics, Computer Vision and Machine Learning from Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay.

My research interests lie in Machine Learning, Optimization, Computer Vision and their applications to Robotics.
