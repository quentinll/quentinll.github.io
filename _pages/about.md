I am a Ph.D. student under the supervision of [Justin Carpentier](https://jcarpent.github.io/), [Ivan Laptev](https://www.di.ens.fr/~laptev/), and [Cordelia Schmid](https://cordeliaschmid.github.io/).

My research interests are in Machine Learning, Optimization, and Computer Vision, particularly as applied to Robotics. I also work on the open-source [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio) and [Simple](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/Simple) libraries, making differentiable physics tools accessible for the robotics community.

Prior to my Ph.D., I received an engineering degree from École Polytechnique and an MSc in Mathematics, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning from École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay.
